## The origin...

I originally launched QuickHub as a paid application on the Mac App Store in the late 2011. As of today (11/2013), the application has been downloaded hundreds of times and git great feedback from users and some github employees.

To be honest, I originally started to learn Objective-C for fun by coding QuickHub since I am a big fan of github so there are probably lots of bugs, bad patterns, and obviously memory leaks (come on guys I am a Java developer ;) ).

Today I have other challenges and no more time to work on the application so I decided to open source it.

Let's bring quickhub to a new level : Fork it and send your pull requests!

## Howto

Clone me...

    git clone https://github.com/chamerling/QuickHubApp.git

Then open project in XCode to run and build it...
