# What is QuickHub.App?
QuickHub.App is an OS X application which stands in the OS X status bar. It allows to quickly access your GitHub stuff from a dynamic menu. From this menu you can access to your repositories, organizations, issues, gists, (and more to come)...

# Who is behind QuickHub?
My name is Christophe Hamerling, I am a software engineer at [PetalsLink](http://petalslink.com/), a french Open Source company delivering SOA tools. I am a big lover of OS X, Growl and GitHub and that's why I started to developed QuickHub to be able to be always connected to GitHub.
