QuickHub 1.0 has finally been validated by Apple. It is now available for download on the [Mac App Store](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/quickhub/id476665193).

It took almost one week to Apple to validate the application. During this week, I added lot of things to QuickHub. The version 1.1 will be sent to Apple in the next days. Stay tuned.

Please fill free to comment, send feedback ad share this to the world!
