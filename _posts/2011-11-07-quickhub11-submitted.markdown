QuickHub 1.1 has been submitted for review to Apple. This time, the review process should be faster! This version comes with many improvements on the UI side, some Internet availability fixes, but also provides way to create gists directly from QuickHub. Have a look to the [release notes]({{ site.url }}/pages/releasenotes.html) for more details.
