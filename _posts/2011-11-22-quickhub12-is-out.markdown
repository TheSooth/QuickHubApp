Because short release cycle are better (and also because I added several cool things), Quickhub 1.2 is already here. As usual, it is available on the [Mac App Store](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/quickhub/id476665193).

Several bug fixes and some new features are available in this version. My favorite one is the drag and drop support for gists creation (there is also a new logo, but I am not satisfied with it, so will have a look to find ideas about it later, if yoou have ideas let me know). All details are given in the [release notes]({{ site.url }}/pages/releasenotes.html).
