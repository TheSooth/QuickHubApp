Here it is: QuickHub 1.4 has just been validated and published to the [Mac App Store](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/quickhub/id476665193 "Mac App Store - QuickHub").

One more time, there are many fixes, improvments and two new features which have been asked by users : Issues creation and organization repository creation directly from QuickHub. For the other items, just have a look to this list:

- [NEW] Create issues for your repositories. *For now you can only create issues for your own repositories and not for the organization ones. I have to investigate more on the API side for that but it seems that it is not available or documented for now.*
- [NEW] Create repositories for organizations.* All is in the title...*
- [IMPROVEMENT] Better issues display with repository name as prefix. *Issues where displayed just with their title and so it was not easy to know the linked repository. So items are now prefixed in repository names (and organization name is needed).*
- [IMPROVEMENT] Issue item now have the submitter avatar as icon. 
- [IMPROVEMENT] Better error display when creating repositories.
- [IMPROVEMENT] Data is loaded in the background... *This one is important, data is loaded in the background so the UI will not freeze and app startup will be better.*
- [FIX] Bad link on 'Repositories/Open' menu item
- [FIX] Fix windows close
- [FIX] Fix wiki and issues choice when creating repository
- [FIX] Regression on the number of items returned by the API call

All comments are welcome. I will be pleased to reply to them. There are some on the Mac App Store but it does not provide any way to reply, which is annoying when some users are giving bad review. But bad reviews also give motivation to enhance QuickHub and the current version is just the proof!

Do not hesitate to send me your ideas for QuickHub, I already added some in the last releases, so thanks all for that!

Finally, note that there are still some promo code available to get QuickHub for free, more information on [my tech blog
