QuickHub 1.6 has just been published on the [Mac App Store](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/quickhub/id476665193 "Mac App Store - QuickHub").

There are two new things in this version: A quick access to main **actions** and tons of new notifications generated from github **events**.

## Actions
Actions are distributed across menus and it is sometimes too long to access them. You have now the choice to add an action menu from the preferences. This one will appear on the top and contains actions to create gists, issues and repositories.

## Events
Github is full of events: When you start watching repository, following a developer, or when someone forks, creates an issue, comments something, creates a pull request, ... These events are the ones you can see on the main github page and are now available in QuickHub: There are Growl notifications but also a menu where you can see your last 20 events.

Note that if you are a social and development addict, you can receive tons of notifications. You can filter or unactivate them from the preferences menu.

Hope that all this new stuff will be useful to you and that you will enjoy it.
Cheers!
