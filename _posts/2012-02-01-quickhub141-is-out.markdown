QuickHub 1.4.1 has just been released and is already available on the [Mac App Store](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/quickhub/id476665193 "Mac App Store - QuickHub").

This version of QuickHub is a maintenance release. There is no new feature but only some fixes and improvements for better user experience:

- [IMPROVEMENT] The menu items are now listed in alphabetical order for repositories, organizations and users. This is really better to order these in QuickHub. Easier to find what you are looking for (while waiting for the search engine coming in a future version...).
- [IMPROVEMENT] Better Growl messages. You may have noticed some incoherent messages, they have been fixed!
- [FIX] Some Growl notifications are lost
- [FIX] Several typos

QuickHub 1.5 is already under development and it will provide some new and cool features which will ease your developer life again. Stay tuned!
