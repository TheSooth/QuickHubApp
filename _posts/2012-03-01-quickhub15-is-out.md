QuickHub 1.5 has just been released and is already available on the [Mac App Store](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/quickhub/id476665193 "Mac App Store - QuickHub").

This version is now faster, fixes several issues and comes with a new feature called 'ID cards':

Note that the ID card also contains a clone button. Clicking on this button will launch the excellent [Github for Mac](http://mac.github.com/ "GitHub for Mac") as it will launch if you click on the Clone button from a github.com repository page.

What do you think about ID cards? Do you think we should extend it to issues, users, pull requests? Comments are welcome!

Time is now to think about QuickHub 2.0. Hope to give you news about that soon!
