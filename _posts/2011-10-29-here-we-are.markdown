I finally submitted QuickHub to the Mac App Store last night. This tiny application stands in your OS X menu bar and let you access to your GitHub stuff directly from this dynamic menu.

1. Configure your access from the preferences (will use your system git preferences later)
2. Get your repositories, organizations, open issues, created gists. This is periodically updated. Period tuning is planned
3. Be notified with Growl when something changes
4. There will be many others items in the next future...

You can also Check out the *quick* documentation [here]({{ site.url }}/pages/documentation.html "Documentation").

Please fill free to comment, send feedback ad share this to the world!
