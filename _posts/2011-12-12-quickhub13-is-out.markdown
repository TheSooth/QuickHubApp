QuickHub 1.3 is here and there are some fun things inside! The first and most important one is the support of OAuth: You are no more asked to give your GitHub password to QuickHub. After some discussions with users, I am sure that this will really help QuickHub to extend its usage.

The other nice feature is for Gist lovers. QuickHub is now available in your 'services' menu so you can create Gists from cmd+click or from your 'Services' menu item as showed here:

Several bug fixes and some new features are also available in this version. All details are given in the [release notes]({{ site.url }}/pages/releasenotes.html).

Please feel free to send comments and ideas and thanks all for your support.
