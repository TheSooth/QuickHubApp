QuickHub 1.4.2 has just been released and is already available on the [Mac App Store](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/quickhub/id476665193 "Mac App Store - QuickHub").

This version of QuickHub is a maintenance release. Thanks to the user feedback which allowed to fix the following issues:

- [FIX] Bad menu items when no data is available
- [FIX] Bad profile display when user has not filled its profile on github
