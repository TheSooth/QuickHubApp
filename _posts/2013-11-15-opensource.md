title: QuickHub is now open source

Hi Hackers!

As promised this summer, I took some time to clean the code and it is finally time to open source QuickHub.

QuickHub is now available under the MIT License on github at [https://github.com/chamerling/QuickHubApp](https://github.com/chamerling/QuickHubApp). Please feel free to fork and to send your pull requests.

I particulary want to thank the first QuickHub beta tester: Philippe Charri√®re ie [@k33g](http://github.com/k33g) who tested QuickHub and highly suggested to push it on the Mac App Store. At least the sales allowed me to buy some more beers but not that much... You should follow Philippe and have a look to his repositories, he is a REAL (AND BIG) GEEK!

**Note:** Real Objective-C developers will probably found some strange stuff: This is completely normal. I started to learn Objective-C by developing this application and I really think that this is not a language for me ;)

**Note:** My Mac Developer account expires later this month so QuickHub will not be available on the Mac App Store anymore. It will be available on the github release section of the repository.

Now let's hack!
Cheers,
