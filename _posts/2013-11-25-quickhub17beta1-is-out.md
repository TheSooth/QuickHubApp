Hi Hackers!

My Mac developer program ends this month so I want to celeberate this with the first Open Source release of QuickHub.

QuickHub now uses GitHub release feature as distribution support: You get check the release notes and download the app from [https://github.com/chamerling/QuickHubApp/releases/tag/1.7-beta1](https://github.com/chamerling/QuickHubApp/releases/tag/1.7-beta1). 

- Direct download link : [https://github.com/chamerling/QuickHubApp/releases/download/1.7-beta1/QuickHub-1.7-beta1.zip](https://github.com/chamerling/QuickHubApp/releases/download/1.7-beta1/QuickHub-1.7-beta1.zip)
