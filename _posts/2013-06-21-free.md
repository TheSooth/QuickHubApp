Hi Hackers!

QuickHub.app is now free. I have been busy since several months with new baby, new job, new objectives, new ideas and I decided to free it.
I will try to find time this summer to clean it, merge several branches with new features and open source it before the end of the year.

Source will be pushed to github in the QuickHub Organization at [https://github.com/QuickHub](https://github.com/QuickHub).

Stay tuned (and enjoy the sun while not hacking!!!)
