I just pushed the initial version of QuickHub application. This application stands in your menu bar and let you access to your GitHub stuff directly from this dynamic menu.
There are still many work to do (providing an installer is the main point) but right now you can at least:

1. Configure your access from the preferences (will use your system git preferences later)
2. Get your repositories, organizations, open issues, created gists. This is periodically updated. Period tuning is planned.
3. There will be a number 3 in the next future...

You can also Check out the *quick* documentation [here]({{ site.url }}/pages/documentation.html "Documentation").

Please fill free to comment, add issues, send feedback ad share this to the world! And also note that this is an early version, I am a beginner in Cocoa development and I will improve it as soon as I can.
