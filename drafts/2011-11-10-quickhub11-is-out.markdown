Less than one week after the first version, QuickHub 1.1 has just been validated by Apple and is now available on the [Mac App Store](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/quickhub/id476665193).

This version comes with many new things has I explained in the previous article and the one I really like is that you can now create Gists directly from QuickHub. Some cosmetic changes on the UI and other things has described in the [release notes]({{ site.url }}/pages/releasenotes.html).
